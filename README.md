Thus it seems our trained model performed better on the testing set than the training set.

Scope of Improvements

1)Taking a bigger dataset with versatile and large training data.
2) Checking for various algorithms.
3)Optimize the parameters.

 

The practicality of this Project : Now let us refer to the elephant in the room. Is the above code ready to be deployed in the banking systems? A straightforward answer will be NO.

The reasons are:

1) I have used an extremely small dataset.

2) Real-life scenarios are quite different than what we discuss in theory.
